# Char Drivers Learning

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with character device drivers in Linux.

## Overview

Character device drivers are a type of device driver in Linux that manage character devices, which transfer data to and from the system in a sequential manner. This repository contains code examples, experiments, and documentation to aid in understanding these drivers.

## Contents

- **hello_driver**: A "Hello World" level implementation of a character driver.
- **multi_driver**: Creates multiple devices and manages a buffer for each of them.
- **advanced_driver**: Allows the creation of multiple devices using an `ioctl` call and manages a buffer for each of them.
